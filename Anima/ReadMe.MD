## How does this work?

Well I am really not into mood of writing how this works. I'm sorry- just see the demos and you will figure out on your own how this works
(really it's not that hard) and I'd be very very happy if you fork this repo and update the ReadMe.md file explaining how Anima works. 

## Is this Another LOVE2D Animation Library?
No this isn't another love2d animation library. Most of them out there such as anim8 are about
sprite animation but Anima is not about cutting out sprites from huge atlases. You will have to do
that the traditional way if you want sprites in Anima.
So if it is not about the sprite animation then what is it about- The Actual Animation be it
technical animation, cutscenes, path animations or what not. So generally speaking, Anima is about keyframe animation.
