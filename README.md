## A quick Introduction to lovelib

How would you react if I tell you could do this animation (in love2d) in just three lines of code*

  <span style="align: center">Wow! You could do that in just <b><i>three lines of code </i></b></span>
  </p>


<i>*Three lines of Anima code (the boiler-plate code, the lines required for table init, etc are not counted as they can vary from person to person)</i>

Okay this was particular of Anima but other libraries are awesome as well. If you are particularly interested in Anima (like most people would be then click on the image above)

## So what is lovelib
For starters lovelib is a collection of libraries not a library itself. All of my libraries go here (along with lovecc and Anima). If you want to see what these tiny libraries can do then head on to each one of these "sub-repositories" i mean folders. First head on to Anima.
